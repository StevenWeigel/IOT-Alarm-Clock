# IOT Alarm Clock

This project uses an Arduino MKR Wifi board. A LCD display and a speaker are required as well. The output pins can be found within the .c files.

## Getting Started

- Edit the arduino_secrets.h to contain the target Wifi SSID and password.

- Program the MKR Wifi board with the compiler IoT-Alarm_Arduino_Code

- Create an interface using Arduino IoT Cloud that uses the required controls listed in the .c files
